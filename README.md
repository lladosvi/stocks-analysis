# stocks-analysis

**Overview of the Project**

The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code generated as part of the class traing. The code objective was to use certain available stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.
